## Description

NewsApp is an Android application focusing on providing news articles to users. This project emphasizes **MVVM architecture** and **Hilt Dependency Injection** for efficient and maintainable code. It utilizes **Kotlin** as the primary language and incorporates libraries like **Retrofit** for network calls and **Navigation graph** for navigation between screens.

### Technologies Used:

- **Kotlin**
- **Retrofit**
- **Navigation Graph**
- **Hilt Dependency Injection**
- **MVVM**

NewsApp fetches news sources from an API and displays them to the users. Users can then select a news source to view the top headlines from that source on the next screen.
